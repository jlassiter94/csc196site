    <p>5G stands for 5th generation mobile network, and it’s an improvement upon 4G, or 4th generation mobile network. 4G is currently widely used in today’s mobile devices. There isn’t much difference between low-bandwidth and medium-bandwidth 4G and 5G, but 5G provides new encoding methods that enable the use of higher bandwidths, and therefore, <bold>higher speeds of information transfer.</bold> These higher speeds are only available on today’s higher-end smartphones like the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/">Galaxy S21</a> and Iphone 12, but the low and medium bandwidths will be available on a larger variety of different phones.</p>
